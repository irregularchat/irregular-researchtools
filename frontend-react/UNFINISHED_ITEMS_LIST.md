## 🎯 Priority Assessment

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking features)

1. **Evidence Linking API Integration** (8 items)
   - Critical for evidence-based analysis workflows
   - Affects DeceptionView and GenericFrameworkView
   - Est. time: 6-8 hours

2. **MOM Assessment Modals** (6 items)
   - Blocks deception analysis from Actor/Event pages
   - UI buttons exist but no functionality
   - Est. time: 4-6 hours

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (UX improvements)

3. **Network Graph Enhancements** (2 items)
   - Entity names and path highlighting
   - Improves usability but not blocking
   - Est. time: 3-4 hours

4. **Batch AI Processing** (1 item)
   - Performance improvement for bulk operations
   - Est. time: 3-4 hours

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice-to-haves)

5. **Relationship Auto-generation** (2 items)
   - COG/Causeway framework relationship mapping
   - Advanced feature, not critical
   - Est. time: 4-6 hours

6. **Authentication System** (1 item)
   - Currently using hash-based workaround
   - Low priority unless multi-user needed
   - Est. time: 8-12 hours

## 🔄 Next Actions

### Sprint Focus: Evidence Linking System (Week of Oct 7)
**Goal:** Complete all 8 evidence linking TODOs

**Tasks:**
1. Create evidence linking API endpoints
   - POST `/api/frameworks/:id/evidence` - Link evidence
   - DELETE `/api/frameworks/:id/evidence/:evidence_id` - Unlink
   - GET `/api/frameworks/:id/evidence` - Get linked evidence

2. Update DeceptionView component
   - Integrate with evidence linking API
   - Implement relationship generation
   - Add sharing functionality

3. Update GenericFrameworkView component
   - Same API integration as DeceptionView
   - Add COG/Causeway relationship logic

4. Add UI feedback
   - Success toasts for link/unlink
   - Network graph refresh after relationships

**Success Criteria:**
- Evidence can be linked to any framework
- Links persist to database
- Network graph updates automatically
- Relationships auto-generate for COG/Causeway

## 📝 Technical Debt Notes

### Code Quality Issues
- **Duplicate TODOs**: Lines 446 and 460 in EventDetailView.tsx
- **Missing error handling**: Evidence linking has no error boundaries
- **No loading states**: Link/unlink operations need spinners
- **Type inconsistencies**: Some entity IDs are strings, others numbers

### Performance Concerns
- **N+1 queries**: Entity names loaded one-by-one (line 71, ActorDetailView)
- **No caching**: Evidence links re-fetched on every render
- **Bundle size**: Evidence components not code-split
